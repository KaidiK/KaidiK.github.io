I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistis in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/vanderbilt-department-biostatistics) at Vanderbilt University, advised by [Dr. Simon Vandekar](https://simonvandekar.github.io/). 

My research focuses on three parts: 

+ **Effect sizes**: my dissertation work focuses on the development and application of the *robust effect size index* (RESI) -- a universally applicable effect size reporting framework, aiming to facilitate the result communication between studies using different effect size indices. 
+ **Study replicability**: engaged in the methodological work aiming to help improve the effect sizes and replicability in brain-behavior association studies, especially in studies using longitudinal data. 
+ **Alzheimer's disease progression modeling**: building a non-linear mixed effects model to characterize the overall disease progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the "fragmentary" data commonly seen in AD studies such as [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) and [NACC](https://naccdata.org/).
