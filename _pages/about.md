I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Data Science at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Biostatistics from [Vanderbilt Univeristy](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/vanderbilt-department-biostatistics), under the supervision from [Dr. Simon Vandekar](https://simonvandekar.github.io/). 

My research interests lie on developing and applying statistical methods to address raising critical problems in various biomedical fields, including Psychiatry, Psychology, Alzheimer's disease and Neuroscience, by leveraging and integrating data from large-scale, multi-scource studies. My research involves effect size index development, replicability of brain-wide association studies (BWAS), and advanced longitudinal modeling for complex-structured data.

I also pursue broad collaborative interests in medicine and public health. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me at kkang@wakehealth.edu
