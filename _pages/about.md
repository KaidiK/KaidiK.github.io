I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistis in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/vanderbilt-department-biostatistics) at Vanderbilt University, advised by [Dr. Simon Vandekar](https://simonvandekar.github.io/). 

My research focuses on developing and applying a universally applicable **effect size** reporting framework, aiming to facilitate the result communication between studies using different effect size indices. Recently, utilizing our proposed effect size reporting framework, we are engaged in the methodological work to help address the growing concerns about low **replicability** in brain-behavior association studies. In addition, I have been participating in the development of statistical models to characterize the overall disease progression of **Alzheimer's disease** (AD) using the "fragmentary" data commonly seen in AD studies such as [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) and [NACC](https://naccdata.org/).

I have been very fortunate to work with many amazing researchers. My collaboration interests span various fields, including psychiatry, geriatric medicine, neuroimaging, and health equity. 

Beyond my work, I also enjoy playing Kendo (剑道, a kind of Japanese martial art), hiking, fishing and photography. I currently hold a black belt (1-Dan) in Kendo and am an active member of Nashville Kendo Club. I have been actively participating in many regional and national Kendo tournaments, including 2023 All US Kendo Championships.
